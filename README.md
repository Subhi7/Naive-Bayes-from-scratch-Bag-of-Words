# Naive Bayes algorithm written from scratch to classify reviews

This project aims to - 

a) learn to understand Naive Bayes algorithm, and 

b) learn to handle text, a form of data that does not come as a table of numbers. 

c)Also to own Naive Bayes classifier and use this for categorizing Rotten Tomatoes reviews into rotten and fresh ones. 

d)Finally, I also added the optimal smoothing parameter for better classification.
