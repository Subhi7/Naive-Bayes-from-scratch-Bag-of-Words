# Naive-Bayes-from-scratch-Bag-of-Words-
This project taught me to - a) learn to understand Naive Bayes, and b) learn to handle text, a form of data that does not come as a table of numbers. Also to own Naive Bayes classifier and use this for categorizing Rotten Tomatoes reviews into rotten and fresh ones. Finally, I also added the optimal smoothing parameter.
